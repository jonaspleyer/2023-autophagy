== Paper TODO

- Produce plot with high aviditiy and high affinity interactions
  - 3 Main parameters: interactions (protein-protein, protein-cargo) and stochastic motion (protein)
  - explore parameter space with all 3
  - produce plot
- use morse potential
- can we assess if it makes a difference to have two different proteins? (eg. split up what is currently R11 and pretend that it is atg11 and atg19)
  - they bind strongly to each other
  - they have similar properties to the previous R11 particle
